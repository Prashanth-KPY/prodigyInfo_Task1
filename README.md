# 🚀 Prodigy InfoTech Internship Tasks – By Konda Prashanth

Welcome to my internship task repository from **Prodigy InfoTech**, where I applied my Data Science skills to solve real-world problems using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each task reflects my approach to learning: clarity, logic, and hands-on impact.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repo contains three core tasks:

### ✅ Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis
- Cleaned and analyzed datasets using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends
- Focused on extracting meaningful insights with clear presentation

### ✅ Task 2 – Regression Models
- Implemented **Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regressor**
- Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE and R²
- Explained each step with comments for better understanding

### ✅ Task 3 – Classification Algorithms
- Applied **Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, and **SVM**
- Compared model performance and tuned hyperparameters
- Highlighted decision boundaries and accuracy trade-offs

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Strengthened my understanding of supervised learning
- Practiced debugging and explaining code in simple terms
- Reinforced my ability to present technical work with clarity

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Konda Prashanth**, a **B.Tech graduate in Data Science** from MLR Institute of Technology. I specialize in Python, Java, C++, and core CS concepts like DSA, DBMS, and OOPs. I’m passionate about teaching, mentoring, and making complex topics easy to understand.

Right now, I’m focused on **advanced interview preparation in DSA java, FullStack and system design**, aiming for product-based roles that challenge both my technical depth and creativity. I believe in clarity, authenticity, and continuous improvement—whether it’s writing clean code, guiding others, or refining my own digital presence.

This internship was more than just a task checklist—it was a chance to reinforce my core strengths and share my learning journey in a way that’s both practical and personal.
