# 🚀 Prodigy InfoTech Internship Tasks – By Konda Prashanth

Welcome to my internship task repository from **Prodigy InfoTech**, where I applied my Data Science skills to solve real-world problems using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each task reflects my approach to learning: clarity, logic, and hands-on impact.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repo contains three core tasks:

### ✅ Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis
- Cleaned and analyzed datasets using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends
- Focused on extracting meaningful insights with clear presentation

### ✅ Task 2 – Regression Models
- Implemented **Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regressor**
- Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE and R²
- Explained each step with comments for better understanding

### ✅ Task 3 – Classification Algorithms
- Applied **Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, and **SVM**
- Compared model performance and tuned hyperparameters
- Highlighted decision boundaries and accuracy trade-offs

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Strengthened my understanding of supervised learning
- Practiced debugging and explaining code in simple terms
- Reinforced my ability to present technical work with clarity

## 👨‍🏫 About Me
I'm a final-year B.Tech student in Data Science and a Software Developer Instructor at Trailbliz. I love teaching, mentoring, and making complex topics easy to grasp. This internship was a great opportunity to apply my skills and share my learning journey.
